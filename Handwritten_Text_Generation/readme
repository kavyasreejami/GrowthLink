Handwriting Generator
This project is a handwriting generation tool that uses machine learning and pre-trained datasets to generate images of handwritten text based on user input. The input can be either typed text or an uploaded file. The application uses Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Tkinter to create the tool's functionality and GUI.

Features
Text Entry: Type text directly into the app to generate handwritten images.

File Upload: Upload a text file, and the app will generate handwritten text based on the file content.

Handwriting Generation: Uses pre-trained handwriting data to generate realistic handwritten text.

Save and View: Save and view the generated handwritten image.

Clear Text: Clears the text entry and generated image.
